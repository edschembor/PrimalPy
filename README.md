PrimalPy
========

PrimalPy is a prime number-focused package written in Python. Right now, it is mainly a jumbled collection of primality tests.

Current goal is creating algorithms for various primality tests and test cases to make sure all algoritms work properly. Also, prime generation algorithms are being written and work will be done to clean and formalize the project.
